# MEAN-stack
The above project is a real time application of MEAN Stack technology.
The project is an application for a University. The application is a form that needs to be filled and submitted.
The form is built using MongoDB, Express Js, Angular Js and Node Js.
The appearance or the physical view of the web page is built using Angular Js.
The form even generates an OTP that is to be entered to verify the users.
The Node Js and Express Js are used to built the architecture of backend of web page.
Upon filling in the details and submitting the form, a mail is sent to the user stating that" He/She is successfully registered."
The database used can be  MongoDB or mLab.
There is even a retrieve button, which reveals all the filled details in a tabular format.
This is a basic application of the MEAN Stack technology, which uses the complete MEAN Stack technology  at a bare minimum and can be developed further for higher applications.
                Hope, this is a useful project and can be a mini project for many.
